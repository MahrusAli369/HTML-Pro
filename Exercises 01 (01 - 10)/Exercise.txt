Exercise 1: Working with Table Headers and Scope
Objective: Practice using <table>, <thead>, <tbody>, and the scope attribute for accessibility.

Instructions:
Create a table showing student data — Roll No, Name, Age, and Region.
Use <th> for both column and row headings.
Add proper scope="col" for the header row and scope="row" for each student's row header.
Add a border to make it visible.

Expected Output Example:
+--------+----------+-----+--------+
| R#     | Name| Age | Region |
+--------+----------+-----+--------+
| 1      | Alice    | 43  | North  |
| 2     | Bob      | 24  | South  |
+--------+----------+-----+--------+


Exercise 2: Class and ID Styling Practice
Objective: Understand how to use valid class and ID names in HTML and style them using CSS.
Instructions:
1. Create a <div class="container"> with several <div> elements inside it.
2. Give each one a different valid class name:
    => _now (red text, large font)
    => ABC (green text, underlined)
    => abc (orange background)
    => a29 (black background, yellow text)
3. Add a few invalid examples (like 23, !sd, @new) and show in plain text that they are not valid.
4. Use an <h1> at the top titled “Valid and Invalid Class Names”.


Exercise 3: Duplicate ID Problem Demonstration
Objective: Observe how duplicate IDs affect CSS and JavaScript.

Instructions:
1.     Create two <div> elements with the same ID id="aDiv".
2.    Add CSS to color elements with that ID red.
3.    Use a <pre> section to include this JavaScript example:

                var html = document.getElementById("aDiv").innerHTML;
                alert(html);

4.    Predict and describe which element’s content the JavaScript will return.
5.    Then fix it by giving each <div> a unique ID and use document.querySelectorAll() to handle both.
